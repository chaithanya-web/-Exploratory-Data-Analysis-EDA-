# Housing Data Analysis

This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the California housing dataset. We use popular **Python** libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` to discover meaningful patterns and understand key relationships in the data. The ultimate goal is to gain better insights into housing trends in California.

## üìÅ Dataset

The dataset we're working with is `housing.csv`, which includes details such as:
- Median house value
- Median income
- Number of households
- Total rooms
- Ocean proximity (a categorical feature)
- And several other useful features

## üß∞ Tools & Libraries Used

- **Pandas**: For loading and manipulating data  
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations  
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing data with basic plots  
- **Seaborn**: For creating more advanced and attractive visualizations

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis Steps

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Load the Dataset
We begin by loading the housing data into a DataFrame using `pandas.read_csv()`.

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Explore the Data
We explore the dataset using:
- `.info()` to understand the structure
- `.describe()` to get summary statistics
- `.isnull().sum()` to check for missing values

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Visualizations

1. **Distribution of Median House Value**  
   This histogram shows how house values are distributed across different price ranges.

2. **Correlation Heatmap**  
   A heatmap helps us see which numeric features are strongly correlated, especially how `median_income` relates to `median_house_value`.

3. **Scatterplot: Median Income vs Median House Value**  
   This scatterplot reveals how income levels influence housing prices.

4. **Distribution of Households**  
   A histogram that gives insights into how household sizes vary across the dataset.

5. **Countplot: Ocean Proximity**  
   A bar chart that visualizes how many houses are located at different distances from the ocean.

## üîç Key Insights

- **Skewed House Values**: House values are not evenly distributed ‚Äî the distribution is skewed toward the higher end.
- **Income Influence**: There's a strong positive correlation between income and house value.
- **Household Spread**: Most areas have a relatively low number of households, but there are some regions with high density.
- **Ocean Proximity**: The proximity to the ocean appears to impact both the number and value of houses.

## üìå Conclusion

This EDA provides a strong starting point for understanding California housing data. Next steps might include:
- Developing regression models to predict housing prices
- Applying feature engineering to enhance model performance
- Investigating geographic or regional patterns for more granular insights
